Reverse Meta Prompting

Can you give me a detailed "why" information for some of your requirements that it's not fully understood as to
why these commands are to be followed (what are the consequences if not)?

Now put together a detailed instructive prompt end to end I can provide from the beginning next time that captures this all.
